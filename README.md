## Running the application
### Prerequisites 
You need docker desktop or docker compose installed on you're system. If you don't have docker.
I would recommend installing docker desktop as it is very easy to use.

[Docker Desktop Docs](Dhttps://docs.docker.com/desktop/)

### Running the app.
From the src folder. Run the following commands.

Building the container:
```
docker compose build
```

Running the containers:
```
docker compose up -d
```
 
This will get the container up and running for the first time and then after that you can use docker desktop to build / run / check container logs.
